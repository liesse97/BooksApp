        filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he
        sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the
        hobbit Bilbo Baggins.But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained
